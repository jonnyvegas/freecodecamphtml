            Mitch runs SMB 3. He lost the record recently. That's OK though. He still has fun.

            Sometimes people donate a lot of money. Sometimes chat farts.
            It's all in good fun! Join the stream and check it out.

            Chorts happen. They happen often.
            Not sure what one is? Too bad. No one seems to know!

            We discussed we don't know what a chonda is. So I guess we won't know much more.

            A Chonda.

            The chondanator! It isn't necessary to know what a chonda is, just to be one.

        <p>
            Mitch defrauded chat and claimed he hated baconators when he actually loved them
            and wanted to eat them all the time. He couldn't justify the grease intake, so
            he made chat buy the lunch as a scam.
          </p>
          <p>
            He also doesn't give his cats any of his baconators because he's a bully.
            Bat just wants some bacon and cheese. Is this so much to ask?

            Even though we don't know the chorts, we can do them daily anyway. Or at least
            look at them?
          </code>
          <p>
            Chorting happens daily. Who knows when and where? Some possible places include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your mom's house</li>
            <li>Guys coming out of ceilings</li>
            <li>Wendy's</li>
            <li>The ceiling</li>
            <li>The neighbors house via a truck through the front door</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We hope you have enjoyed and chorted a lot! Join us next time for even more 
            chorting and probably chondas! Maybe choizees??? Who can say for sure?!!?!
